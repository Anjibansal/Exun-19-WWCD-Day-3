# Exun-19-WWCD-Day-2

## Instructions for Day2 Activity

1. Students are required to create an 'issue' on the repository on GitHub as a first step.
2. The issue needs to be filed in the following syntax ONLY:
"I found a bug in line #__ in Program_.py/cpp."
3. Whosoever files the issue first, gets a chance to debug it and send a pull request with the corrected code. This corrected code should just have changes to fix the filed bug, and no other moderations.
4. After you create an issue, it is reserved for you to solve for the next T minutes. If you are unable to solve it in that duration, anyone else can take up that bug.
5. In case no one else takes up that bug and you wish it to be reassigned to you, then after a minimum duration of X minutes, you can reassign it to yourself following the same syntax.
6. A team can at a time work on 2 bugs AT THE MOST.
7. Each file has a rated complexity. All bugs in that file are of that complexity only. Detecting and solving a bug of different complexities fetches different scores.
#### "H": 90 (35 for detection and 55 for correction)
#### "M": 60 (20 for detection and 40 for correction)
#### "E": 40 (10 for detection and 30 for correction)
8. In case of a tie of scores, time of creating pull request shall be taken into consideration and code quality. 
9. In implementation questions, there are no points for error detection.
10. Each team can do a maximum of 2 'E' complexity questions.
### T = 20 minutes, X = 15 minutes
